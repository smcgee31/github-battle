This is the code from following Tyler McGinnis' React.js Program tutorial - first small project of the cirriculum

If you are going to clone be sure to:
1. 'npm install' to install the dependencies from package.json
2. and then: 'npm run production' if you are wanting webpack to create the /dist folder with the production files.

Using 'npm run start' will run webpack-dev-server for watching your files for changes and rebuilding.
